Mule Cassandra Module
====================

Mule Module support for Cassandra.

The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability and high availability without
compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure
make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple
datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that
you can survive regional outages.
