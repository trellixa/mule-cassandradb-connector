= Cassandra Connector Release Notes
:keywords: cassandra

*June 2018*

_Select_

The Anypoint Cassandra connector provides the capability to connect a Mule app to a Cassandra database or cluster. The MuleSoft support category for the Cassandra connector is link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/anypoint-connectors#connector-categories[Select]. 

== 2.1.1
*October 2018* (unreleased)

This version was updated to use the latest release of the Datastax Java Driver for Apache CassandraÂ®, v3.6.0.

== 2.1.0
*June 2018*

This version supports Cassandra cluster setting. Users can provide a comma separate Cassandra server information (127.0.0.1:9160, 127.0.0.2:9160).

== 2.0.0

*May 2017*

The Cassandra connector was implemented using the DataStax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra 3.1. The connector is compatible with the following software:

* Cassandra database or cluster 1.2 or later
* Cassandra 3.0.11 or earlier if you use the Change Column Type operation
* CQL spec 3.x
* Anypoint Studio 6.x and Mule Runtime 3.6 or later, or Mule Runtime only

The capability to change the data type of a column using the CQL alter table query was removed from Cassandra 3.0.11 and later; consequently, the Cassandra connector Change Column Type operation does not work if you connect to a Cassandra database that does not support this capability.


== Key Features

The Cassandra connector supports the following capabilities:

* Basic Authentication for accessing the database as configured in the cassandra.yaml
* Executing any CQL query using a custom POJO
* Performing the following Cassandra Query Language (CQL) database operations, which are described in the Cassandra Connector javadoc, using a wizard:
+

| Change column type | Delete rows | Drop keyspace | Update 
| Create keyspace | Drop Column  | Rename column |

|===
+
* Configuring Cassandra cluster operations, such as compression and SSL
